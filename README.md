# Lead Generation Automation Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script designed to automate the lead generation process from Google Maps, manage collected data in Google Sheets, and conduct personalized email outreach using the ChatGPT API and an email service. The script aims to streamline the workflow for businesses seeking to expand their customer base and enhance engagement with potential leads.

## Key Features

- **Google Maps Scraping:** Utilizes Python libraries such as Selenium and Requests to extract business data (business name, address, phone number, website) from Google Maps.

- **Google Sheets Integration:** Utilizes Google Sheets API to organize and store the collected data in a structured manner.

- **ChatGPT API Integration:** Generates personalized email content for each lead using the ChatGPT API based on lead information.

- **Email Outreach:** Uses an SMTP library to automate the sending of personalized emails to potential leads.

- **Robustness and Security:** Implements error handling, exception management, data validation, and sanitization to ensure script robustness, data accuracy, and maintains data privacy and security throughout the process.
